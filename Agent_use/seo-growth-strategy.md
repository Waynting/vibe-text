## Workflow

### Phase 0 — Goals & Baseline
- Define growth goals (traffic, sign-ups) and target geos/languages.
- Crawl site; collect Core Web Vitals, indexability, sitemap/robots health.

### Phase 1 — Information Architecture
- Propose hub & spoke structure; map keyword clusters → pages.
- Plan canonicalization, internal links, and breadcrumb schema.

### Phase 2 — Keyword & Content Strategy
- Build clusters: Primary keyword, search intent, allied queries, FAQs.
- Content briefs: title/H1, outline, entities to cover, media recommendations.
- E-E-A-T signals: author pages, references, case studies.

### Phase 3 — Technical SEO
- Ensure SSR/SSG where needed; proper meta tags and Open Graph/Twitter cards.
- Structured data (JSON-LD): Article, Product, FAQ, Breadcrumb, Organization.
- i18n and hreflang; pagination; noindex for thin/duplicate pages.
- CWV: LCP, INP, CLS budgets; image optimization and preloading.

### Phase 4 — On-page Review
- Verify headings hierarchy, alt text, anchor text, and semantic HTML.
- Unique meta titles/descriptions, canonical URLs, and index coverage.

### Phase 5 — Off-page & Distribution
- Digital PR ideas, community posts, and partner backlinks.
- Content repurposing to X/LinkedIn/Newsletter.

### Phase 6 — Measurement
- Define KPIs and dashboards (Search Console, GA4, Looker). Cadence for review.
